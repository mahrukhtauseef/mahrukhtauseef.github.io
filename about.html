    Hi, I’m Mahrukh. I come from a teeny tiny town in Pakistan called Toba Tek Singh. I hated growing up in Toba. I was convinced it was putting me at a disadvantage given the limited opportunities. But in hindsight, Toba played a huge role in molding me. It taught me to make more with less and to thrive in scarcity.

I was always fond of school and did considerably well. At 14, I realized I had outgrown the education system in Toba and convinced my parents to send me to a boarding school — a bold and uncommon step for girls in my town. It felt like I gave away my childhood in pursuit of purpose. Since then, I’ve lived in Abu Dhabi, New York, and now Nashville — chasing that purpose.
<br>
   
Each city shaped me. Abu Dhabi challenged my beliefs. I studied alongside people from over 80 countries, engaging in eye-opening discussions. I take a lot of pride in the kindness and openness this experience instilled in me.

Next, I lived in New York for a year and found my forever home. This is where I embraced my true self — quirky, bold, vibrant. Its energy resonated deeply and made me want to build something bigger than myself.

My Ph.D. brought me to Nashville, where I’ve been living for four years. Nashville grounded me. Through my Ph.D., I got to try a hundred different things and found what I really want to do.
    
<br>
I’m a technologist, a builder, and a believer in meaningful design. My passion lies in Human-Computer Interaction. I want to design tools that help people — tools that make a difference, even in small ways. I don’t attach myself to specific platforms or technologies; I know I can learn whatever the problem demands.

My dream job is simple: to wake up every day and solve real-world problems — both the shark bites and the mosquito bites — always led by the question: who does this help?
